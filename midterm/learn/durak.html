            <span class="durak-title">Durak</span> is a Russian origin card game of attack and defense.
        </p>

        <p class="rule-section">
            It is said that in this game there are <span class="emphasis">no winners, only one loser</span>. The last person with cards in their hand is the loser (the fool or "durak").
        </p>

        <p class="rule-section">
            The objective is to play all your cards before your opponents in several rounds of attack and defense until there are no cards left in the deck.
        </p>

        <p class="rule-section">
            It is played with 36 cards of the standard deck, from lowest to highest value from 6 to ace, ace being highest.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-title">How to play Durak</h3>
        
        <p class="rule-section">
            Although the rules seem complex, once you start playing it's very simple.
        </p>

        <p class="rule-section">
            Before starting a card is placed face up (crossed under the deck) that will indicate the "trump" suit.
        </p>

        <p class="rule-section">
            Each player is dealt 6 cards. If any player has all red, black or 5 cards of the same suit, cards must be dealt again.
        </p>

        <p class="rule-section">
            In each round there is <span class="emphasis">a defender</span> (indicated with a shield) and <span class="emphasis">three attackers</span>.
        </p>

        <p class="rule-section">
            The player who has the lowest trump card in their hand starts attacking.<br>
            The player on their left is the defender.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Attack and defense</h3>
        
        <p class="rule-section">
            The attacker plays a card face up on the table.<br>
            The defender must respond with a higher card of the same suit or a trump suit card in order not to lose the defense.<br>
            As many attacks can be made as the defender has cards up to a maximum of 6.
        </p>

        <p class="rule-section">
            To attack again there must be a card of the same value on the table.<br>
            If a player can no longer attack, they pass the turn to the player on their left.<br>
            For example, player 1 attacks with 6♠. The defender responds with a Q♠. Player 1 could attack again with a 6 or a Q of any suit.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-title">End of the round</h3>
        
        <p class="rule-section">
            The round ends when all players had a chance to attack or the maximum number of attacks was reached.
        </p>

        <p class="rule-section">
            If the defender has succeeded, all cards on the table will be discarded and he/she will be the first to attack in the next round.<br>
            If the defender fails, they must draw all the cards from the table and lose the turn to attack in the next round.<br>
            At the end of the round, all players must draw from the deck in order until they have 6 cards again, first, the attacker players and last, the defender.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-title">End of the game</h3>
        
        <p class="rule-section">
            The first player who has no cards left, wins as long as there are no cards available to draw.
        </p>

        <p class="rule-section">
            The other players will keep playing to save themselves from being the «fool».
