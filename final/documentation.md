This is my midterm project submission for the Sp25 Web Dev Class.

This is the beginning of a card game website I am implementing.

I have implemented a home page, one sample rule page, and one sample "free play" page for the Durak game only. I also implemented a dark mode and light mode toggle button. Also, clicking on the learn/play buttons will change which links the card icons redirect to without having to leave the page. Cool stuff.

I still have yet to create most of my links, to other games' rules and actual in game implementation. I ended up working with javascript a fair bit more than I expected to be, but it was fun. Shout out W3 schools for the guidance. 

I marked which snippets of code I wanted to highlight that I figured out online in comments within the .js file itself, hopefully that suffices.


Stuff to add in the future to this website:

- add all of the sidebar pages/links
- add chat button, add videochat buttons in game
- add login/sign up pages
- add social media picture icons
- add all learn pages
- in the end, refine color choices, make sure everything looks uniform across the pages for both dark and light mode


harder stuff to do:
- add game functionality to all game options, or at least one!
- add a database for all the users
- learn more about how to get a live chat/live video running, probaly server/network related stuff
